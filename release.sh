# This script is an "easy" self-contained tagging & branching release
# system for git repositories that follow the mainline-versioning
# method described in the following Perforce white paper:
#
# --> http://www.perforce.com/perforce/papers/bestpractices.html <--
#
# Specifically, it grants any user with the ability to perform a
# "git-push" to the blessed "release server" the ability to make a
# new release (by either a branch or tag). Many advanced git users
# may find this script totally unnecessary.
#
SCRIPT_VERSION="1.3.5"
# For updates or examples please visit: http://www.osndok.com/git-release/
#
# BUGS:
#   May fail or produce undesirable results if run to branch from a
#      commit point which is not a head.
#   May give unintuitive errors for failure conditions.
#   Might destroy all your data and eat your children.
#
# LIMITATIONS:
#   To minimize user-errors, will only operate on branches which are
#     tracking remote branches on the blessed release_machine
#     (as defined in this file)
#
# USAGE:
#   Generally, one only needs to run this script with no arguments.
#   Depending on which remote branch (or mainline) the current HEAD
#   follows, this script will automatically increment the version
#   numbers and create the necessary tags and branches.
#
#   While not recommended, minor-branches are partially implemented,
#   and might be created if you are having a good day and call the
#   script with the "--branch' argument. Presently buggy, this will
#   likely only work on the head of the version branch.
#     eg-$> ./release.sh --branch
#
#   When used consistently, one may determine what the "version" of
#   a source tree is by simply examining the version-file; by default
#   this is named ".version".  If this is a whole number, it is from
#   the mainline development branch, if it ends in a period, it is a
#   pre-release (from a version-branch).
#
#   The version file is kept "at-or-above" the release and is tracked
#   using git. A side effect of this is making it harder to merge
#   version-branches (as at least the version files will conflict at
#   the first commit); this is seen as a good thing, as it may indicate
#   when merging branches which don't belong together. A natural
#   consequence of the enumeration is that the head of the mainline
#   will always have the version number of the "NEXT MAJOR RELEASE";
#
#   e.g. if a release "3.1.4" was the last release, the mainline will
#     show "4" as it's version number, and the version-3 branch will
#     show at least "3.2" and the version-3.1 branch will show "3.1.5".
